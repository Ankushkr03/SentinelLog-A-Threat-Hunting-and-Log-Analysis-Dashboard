# 🛡️ SentinelLog: AI-Powered Log Analysis Dashboard

**SentinelLog** is an intelligent threat-hunting dashboard that uses the power of Google's Gemini AI to analyze system and network logs, detect suspicious activities, and visualize security threats in real-time. It transforms raw log files into an interactive, actionable security overview.

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages the Google Gemini API to intelligently parse and analyze log files, identifying complex threat patterns beyond simple rule-based systems.
-   **Multiple Log Formats**: Supports common log types including **SSH**, **Apache**, and **Nginx**.
-   **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes complex data through an intuitive and responsive dashboard with charts, graphs, and tables.
-   **Comprehensive Threat Detection**: Identifies a wide range of threats such as brute-force attacks, directory fuzzing, SQL injection attempts, and suspicious user-agents.
-   **At-a-Glance Metrics**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) like Total Log Entries, Threats Detected, and High-Severity Alerts are front and center.
-   **Visual Timelines**: Tracks threat occurrences over time to help identify attack windows and patterns.
-   **Top Attacker Identification**: Automatically surfaces the most persistent attacker IP addresses.
-   **Detailed Alert System**: Provides detailed, expandable alerts with severity levels, descriptions, and the original log entry for deeper investigation.
-   **Printable Reports**: Generate a clean, printable summary of the analysis with a single click.
-   **Modern UI/UX**: Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts for a clean, fast, and user-friendly experience.

## 🧠 What Problem It Solves

System administrators and security analysts are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of log data generated by servers. Manually sifting through thousands of lines of text to find a single malicious entry is like finding a needle in a haystack.

SentinelLog automates this entire process. Instead of manual analysis, you get:
-   **Automated Log Parsing**: No need to write custom parsers for different log formats.
-   **Intelligent Threat Correlation**: The AI understands the context and identifies sophisticated threats.
-   **Clear Visualizations**: Instantly grasp the security posture through easy-to-understand charts.
-   **Actionable Insights**: Focus on the most critical threats and top attackers immediately.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The application follows a simple yet powerful workflow:

1.  **Upload**: The user drags and drops or browses to upload a log file (`.log`, `.txt`) and selects the corresponding log type (SSH, Apache, or Nginx).
2.  **Analyze**: The frontend reads the file content and sends it to a backend service.
3.  **AI Processing**: A carefully crafted prompt instructs the **Google Gemini API** to act as a world-class cybersecurity analyst. The AI parses the log, identifies threats, aggregates data, and structures the entire analysis into a predefined JSON schema.
4.  **Visualize**: The frontend receives the structured JSON data from the API.
5.  **Dashboard Rendering**: React components consume the JSON data and render the summary metrics, charts, and alert tables, presenting a complete security dashboard to the user.
